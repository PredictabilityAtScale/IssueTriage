# Dashboard Accessibility & Quality Pass

## Overview
Completed the Phase 3 accessibility deliverable by ensuring the IssueTriage dashboard is fully operable via keyboard, announces dynamic updates for assistive technologies, and maintains sufficient focus and contrast cues across the webview experience.

## Implementation Date
October 19, 2025

## Accessibility Enhancements
- **Keyboard-first navigation**: Issue list now exposes listbox semantics with arrow/home/end key navigation, home-row selection, and restoration of focus after filter updates.
- **Focus management & live regions**: Selection changes drive `aria-activedescendant`, status summaries, and polite live regions so screen readers announce repository state, loading, and filter results.
- **Visual focus cues**: Consistent `:focus-visible` outlines, enhanced selected-card styling, and high-contrast safe backgrounds improve visibility in both light and dark themes.
- **Semantic history timeline**: Converted assessment history into an ordered list with list items so chronological context is conveyed to assistive tech.

## Technical Implementation

### Webview (`src/webview/panel.js`)
- Added keyboard handlers for list traversal, Home/End shortcuts, and Enter/Space activation.
- Applied listbox roles, `aria-activedescendant`, and descriptive IDs to issue cards while preserving selection telemetry.
- Normalized focus restoration when data refreshes and reworked export buttons to declare `type="button"` for consistent activation.
- Emitted ordered-list markup for the assessment timeline and ensured active descendant tracking clears when no issues remain.

### Webview Layout (`src/extension.ts`)
- Introduced visually hidden headings, labelled controls, and explicit roles for filters, tabs, list panel, and assessment region.
- Added reusable `.visually-hidden` utility and `:focus-visible` outline styles for buttons, cards, and tabs.
- Tuned selected-card styling with high-contrast borders and refined history timeline list styling.

## Quality Assurance
- `npm run compile` – ✅
- `npm test` – ✅

## Follow-up Work
- Monitor telemetry to confirm keyboard navigation paths are exercised in real-world usage.
- Apply the same accessibility patterns to future dashboard components and periodically audit contrast against upcoming VS Code theme changes.
