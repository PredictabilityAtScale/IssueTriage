# Feature: Automation Integration & Launch

## Objective
Enable maintainers to trigger downstream AI coding agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot automation, external MCP services) from within IssueTriage, with guardrails that respect readiness scores and capture execution outcomes.

## User Value
- Shortens the path from assessed issue to automated implementation.
- Ensures only appropriately prepared issues enter the automation pipeline, reducing failure rates.
- Feeds back automation results to improve future scoring and business analytics.

## Automation Flow
1. **Pre-Launch Validation**
   - Verify readiness score threshold and confidence requirements (configurable per tier).
   - Present checklist of required metadata (acceptance criteria, linked files, reviewers).
   - Allow manual overrides with justification logging for auditability.
2. **Launch Execution**
   - Invoke configured automation target (default: GitHub Copilot Agent via command invocation or API).
   - Package assessment context, issue metadata, and attachments for the agent.
   - Track launch request ID for status polling.
3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Surface real-time status updates (in progress, blocked, completed) inside VS Code.
   - Notify users when automation completes or requires manual intervention.
4. **Outcome Recording**
   - Capture success metrics, time-to-complete, and quality feedback.
   - Feed results into assessment history to refine scoring models.

## Functional Requirements
- Configurable readiness thresholds per subscription tier.
- Support multiple automation targets with pluggable adapters.
- Provide audit log accessible via UsageTap analytics for enterprise compliance.
- Offer kill-switch to halt automation runs and revert state when necessary.
- Expose command palette entry `IssueTriage: Launch Automation` with contextual enablement.

## Technical Notes
- Define adapter interface (`IAutomationAdapter`) with methods for launch, status polling, cancellation, and result retrieval.
- Initial adapter covers GitHub Copilot automation; future adapters may target custom MCP servers.
- Persist launch metadata locally and sync to UsageTap as part of telemetry pipeline.
- Implement notification channel using VS Code `window.showInformationMessage` plus status bar indicators.

## Dependencies
- Reliable assessment engine outputs including confidence metrics.
- Secure storage for automation endpoint credentials/API keys.
- Event bus for broadcasting status changes to dashboard and backlog views.

## Open Questions
- Should automation create pull requests automatically or leave that to the agent? (Coordinate with agent capabilities.)
- How do we handle partial completions or multi-step automations spanning several issues? (Design needed.)
- What rollback semantics are required when automation fails mid-flight? (Clarify with stakeholders.)

## MVP Acceptance Criteria
- Launch flow available for issues meeting readiness threshold.
- Status updates reflected within the IDE and persisted in history.
- Outcome summary recorded and visible in dashboard timeline.

## Post-MVP Enhancements
- Automated remediation when launch fails (e.g., prompt revisions, fallback providers).
- SLA monitoring with alerts for overdue automation tasks.
- Workflow templates for chaining multiple automation actions.
