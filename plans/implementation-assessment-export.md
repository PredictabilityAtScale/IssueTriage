# Assessment Export Actions Implementation

## Overview
Completed Phase 3, Step 3: Assessment export actions, enabling IssueTriage operators to capture the latest assessment results as Markdown or JSON files directly from the dashboard detail pane.

## Implementation Date
October 19, 2025

## Feature Summary
- **Markdown export**: Shares a human-readable report containing issue metadata, readiness, score breakdown, recommendations, and risk insights.
- **JSON export**: Provides structured data for downstream automation with assessment details, readiness metadata, and risk signals.
- **Accessible via dashboard**: Export buttons surface alongside existing assessment actions in the IssueTriage panel.

## Technical Implementation

### Webview (`src/webview/panel.js`)
- Added `Export Markdown` and `Export JSON` buttons to the assessment action toolbar.
- Wired buttons to emit `webview.exportAssessment` messages with selected issue number and desired format.

### Extension Host (`src/extension.ts`)
- Handled new message type `webview.exportAssessment`.
- Added `exportAssessment()` pipeline:
  - Locates the selected issue from the IssueManager snapshot.
  - Retrieves the latest assessment record from `AssessmentService`.
  - Gathers readiness metadata and risk summary for context.
  - Generates content via helper functions:
    - `createMarkdownExport()` – constructs the report using Markdown headings, tables, and lists.
    - `createJsonExport()` – outputs structured JSON with ISO timestamps and optional risk block.
  - Prompts the user for a save location using `showSaveDialog` with pre-filled filenames.
  - Writes the chosen file using Node `fs.promises.writeFile`.
  - Offers to open the exported file immediately and emits telemetry (`assessment.export`).
- Added formatting helpers:
  - `buildDefaultExportUri()` – suggests filenames like `issue-123-assessment.md`/`.json`.
  - `getReadinessMetadata()` – translates readiness keys into labels and descriptions.
  - `createMarkdownRiskSection()` / `buildReadyRiskLines()` – formats risk insights for Markdown.
  - `formatIsoDate()` – normalizes timestamps to ISO strings.

## User Experience Enhancements
- **Consistent placement**: Export actions sit next to existing navigation buttons, reducing friction.
- **Context-rich Markdown**: Includes metadata table, readiness narrative, actionable recommendations, and risk summaries.
- **Automation-ready JSON**: Encodes assessment, readiness, and risk fields for programmatic ingestion.
- **Success feedback**: Confirms export completion and offers immediate preview.

## Quality Assurance
- `npm run compile` (TypeScript, ESLint, esbuild) – ✅
- `npm test` (VS Code integration suite) – ✅ 10 passing
- Manual smoke tests recommended: verify Markdown and JSON exports and ensure actions behave correctly when no issue is selected.

## Follow-up Work
- Telemetry instrumentation enhancements (capture export usage already tracked; expand with filter context).
- Accessibility pass to ensure buttons are keyboard reachable and screen-reader-friendly.
- Consider template customization options or additional export formats in future iterations.
