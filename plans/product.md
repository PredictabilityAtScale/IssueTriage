# IssueTriage

Issue triage is going to have products that analyze backlogs, issues and idea to understand and prepare their readiness for automated AI coding. The need is that there are a lot of issues and work that could be automated by AI with minimal or no manual intervention; but knowing which work needs manual input first needs to be assessed. This first VS Code add-in will look at GitHub issues, and rate them using AI agents and workflow - giving them a score and allowing automated launching to an AI coding agent.

## Product Vision
IssueTriage serves as an intelligent gateway between human-managed issue backlogs and AI-powered automation. By systematically evaluating GitHub issues across multiple dimensions, it identifies which tasks are ready for immediate automation, which need human preparation, and which should remain manual. This creates a more efficient development workflow where AI handles routine, well-defined work while humans focus on complex, creative, and strategic tasks.
