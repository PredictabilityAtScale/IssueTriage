# Vision: Autonomous Intelligent Triage System

## Mission
Transform IssueTriage into the industry-leading risk forecaster and autonomous triage platform that predicts issue complexity, identifies safe automation candidates, and orchestrates unattended AI-driven development workflows with measurable confidence.

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Predictive Risk Intelligence
**Goal**: Forecast risk before any work begins, leveraging deep historical learning and multi-signal analysis.

**Capabilities**:
- **Pre-work Risk Prediction**: Score new issues for expected complexity, churn, and review friction before PRs exist, using similarity matching and ML models trained on repository history.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Surface prediction uncertainty (e.g., "75% confidence this is low-risk based on 12 similar past issues") so teams understand model reliability.
- **Temporal Risk Modeling**: Track how risk evolves over project phases; detect when technical debt or architecture shifts increase baseline risk.
- **Component-Level Heat Maps**: Identify high-risk modules/files/teams; surface when new issues touch risky areas.
- **Outcome Validation Loop**: Compare predicted vs. actual risk after PR merge; retrain models monthly with ground truth to reduce forecast error.

**Implementation Roadmap**:
- Extend `RiskIntelligenceService` to include `PredictedRiskService` that queries pre-trained models or runs similarity lookups.
- Build historical exporter (`scripts/exportHistory.ts`) to create training datasets from public repos (vscode, react, kubernetes).
- Train initial gradient boosting classifiers (scikit-learn/LightGBM) on features: embeddings, label overlap, historical churn averages, author reputation.
- Deploy model artifacts in extension or via lightweight HTTP service; cache predictions in `predicted-risk.db`.
- Surface predictions in assessment comments, webview panels, and feed into OpenRouter prompts as structured context.

### 2. Similarity-Powered Context Retrieval
**Goal**: Automatically find and present the most relevant historical issues/PRs to inform current triage decisions.

**Capabilities**:
- **Semantic + Structural Matching**: Blend text embeddings (title/body) with label Jaccard, component overlap, and file hot-spot similarity.
- **Likeness Summaries**: Generate concise "fingerprints" when issues close (e.g., "Frontend refactor, 3 PRs, 450 LOC, medium review friction") optimized for retrieval.
- **Top-K Retrieval with Evidence**: Return 5-10 most similar past issues with their risk outcomes, drivers, and PR links.
- **Temporal Weighting**: Favor recent history but allow configurable decay to balance recency vs. volume.
- **Cross-Repository Learning**: Aggregate patterns from multiple public repos to bootstrap new/small repositories.

**Implementation Roadmap**:
- Create `SimilarityService` with embedding generation (sentence-transformers or Azure OpenAI), vector storage (Faiss or in-memory ANN for MVP), and hybrid scoring logic.
- Extend `RiskStorage` schema to persist likeness summaries and embedding vectors alongside risk profiles.
- Add `generateLikenessSummary` method that extracts key signals when issues close: labels, files, churn, review comments.
- Expose `findSimilar(repository, issueNumber, topK)` API; integrate into assessment prompt and webview UI.
- Evaluate retrieval quality with precision@k against manually labeled "truly similar" sets.

### 3. Autonomous Workflow Orchestration
**Goal**: Identify issues safe for unattended AI execution and manage end-to-end automation with human-in-the-loop gates.

**Capabilities**:
- **Automation Eligibility Scoring**: Multi-factor model combining:
  - Predicted risk level (only low-risk candidates).
  - Requirements clarity score from assessment (high requirements → more automatable).
  - Historical automation success rate for similar issues.
  - Presence of test coverage signals from CLI tools.
  - Team velocity and author reputation.
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Configurable gates (e.g., "automate only if eligibility ≥85% and risk ≤30").
- **Staged Execution**:
  - **Phase 1**: Auto-generate PR draft, request human review before merge.
  - **Phase 2**: Auto-merge if tests pass and review approval obtained.
  - **Phase 3**: Full unattended (draft → test → merge) for highest-confidence items.
- **Feedback Capture**: Track automation outcomes (success, manual intervention required, rollback) to refine eligibility models.
- **Audit Trail**: Log all automation decisions, scores, and outcomes in `automation-history.db` for compliance and analysis.

**Implementation Roadmap**:
- Extend `AssessmentService` to compute `automationEligibility` score using assessment + risk + similarity signals.
- Create `AutomationOrchestrator` service to:
  - Evaluate eligibility against thresholds.
  - Trigger GitHub Copilot coding agent or alternative automation tooling.
  - Monitor PR status and escalate to humans when confidence drops.
- Build UI controls in webview panel: "Enable Automation", "Review Automation History", "Override Threshold".
- Integrate with existing `issuetriage.automation.launchEnabled` setting; add `automation.confidenceThreshold`, `automation.maxConcurrent`.
- Emit telemetry for all automation events; create weekly digest reports for teams.

### 4. Continuous Learning & Optimization
**Goal**: Establish feedback loops that improve prediction accuracy and automation success over time.

**Capabilities**:
- **Ground Truth Collection**: Capture actual outcomes (merge success, bug reports, rollbacks, security issues) and link to original predictions.
- **Model Retraining Pipeline**: Monthly batch jobs to retrain risk and eligibility models with updated data.
- **A/B Experimentation**: Test multiple model versions or prompt strategies, measure impact on triage accuracy and automation success rate.
- **Drift Detection**: Monitor prediction performance over time; alert when model degrades below baseline.
- **Human Override Analysis**: Study cases where users override automation recommendations; incorporate insights into future models.

**Implementation Roadmap**:
- Add `OutcomeTrackerService` to record PR merge results, post-merge incidents, and link to original assessment/risk records.
- Create `scripts/retrainModels.py` pipeline that reads latest data, trains models, evaluates on hold-out set, and publishes artifacts.
- Integrate experiment tracking (MLflow or W&B) to version models and compare performance metrics.
- Build telemetry dashboards (Grafana, Azure Monitor) showing prediction accuracy, automation success rate, false positive/negative trends.
- Schedule quarterly model audits and publish accuracy reports to stakeholders.

### 5. Multi-Repository Intelligence Network
**Goal**: Aggregate learnings across repositories to provide richer context and bootstrap new projects.

**Capabilities**:
- **Shared Risk Corpus**: Pool anonymized risk profiles and similarity embeddings from participating public/private repos.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train base models on large public repos (vscode, kubernetes), fine-tune on private repos with smaller datasets.
- **Industry Benchmarks**: Compare repo risk profiles against aggregated benchmarks (e.g., "Your API issues are 2x riskier than industry median").
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Surface common patterns from high-performing repos (e.g., "Repos with ≥80% test coverage automation success is 3x higher").

**Implementation Roadmap**:
- Design federated data schema that separates sensitive metadata from sharable features.
- Build opt-in export mechanism for repos to contribute anonymized data to shared corpus.
- Create centralized model registry hosting pre-trained base models.
- Expose repository comparison APIs; integrate into assessment comments and analytics dashboards.
- Publish quarterly industry risk intelligence reports to build community and credibility.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Sparse training data in small repos | Low prediction accuracy | Transfer learning from public repos; bootstrap with heuristics |
| Model bias toward historical patterns | Miss novel issue types | Hybrid approach blending ML with LLM reasoning; human override |
| Automation failures damage trust | Teams disable features | Start with conservative thresholds; require opt-in; extensive telemetry |
| Privacy concerns with shared corpus | Legal/compliance blocks | Anonymization, opt-in only, on-premises deployment option |
